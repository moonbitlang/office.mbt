# Follow-up issues

These are non-blocking follow-ups discovered while investigating slow tests.

1. **Optimize ISO protection hashing**
   - Motivation: workbook/sheet protection tests are slow because `spinCount=100000` is intentionally expensive.
   - Potential improvement: avoid per-iteration buffer concatenation in `gen_iso_password_hash` by implementing incremental/streaming hashing (similar to `excelize/crypt.go`’s `hashing` function with `hash.Hash.Write`).

2. **Keep dynamic-array spill shape inference in sync**
   - The spill shape inference now short-circuits scalar functions and only computes shapes for functions that may spill.
   - If new array-returning functions are added later, the spill allowlist should be updated (tests should catch this, but it’s easy to miss in reviews).
